Our mission at Now I Can is to help children with disabilities reach their full potential and greatest independence.
Intensive Physical Therapy
Now I Can stands apart from other physical therapy centers in many ways, including the use of the Intensive Model of Therapy (IMOT).  Our therapists treat patients 4 hours a day, five days a week for intensive sessions,  Now I Can physical therapists design a tailored program for each patient to help them reach their greatest level of independence. Over the course of a three-week intensive session, children reach their goals and gain developmental skills as therapists have the needed time to use repetition and all the tools at their disposal to help kids meet their potential.  It’s very common for patients to make more progress in three weeks of intensive therapy than they do in 12 months of traditional therapy!  However, we also accommodate local patients for weekly PT visits!

Intensive Physical Therapy
A unique characteristic of Now I Can physical therapy centers is the use of the Intensive Model of Therapy (IMOT).  IMOT originated in Poland, and our founders, the Christensens took their daughter, Colby there to receive this effective therapy. This treatment model has proven to bring results for thousands of children.
Now I Can physical therapists design a tailored program for each patient, designed to meet their individual needs and goals.  During an intensive session, many children gain greater independence and new developmental skills.   It’s very common for patients to see more progress in three weeks of intensive therapy than they do in 12 months of traditional therapy!
During an Intensive Physical Therapy Session, we use the NeuroSuit and the Universal Exercise Unit.  Children from as young as 10 months see great results from intensive physical therapy. Our team will be able to assess if a lighter schedule is best for your child.

What Does the IMOT Schedule Look Like?
Now I Can therapists treat patients for 4 hours a day, five days a week.  An intensive program is three weeks in length, but weekly sessions are also part of Now I Can’s services.
At Now I Can, children work toward their specific functional goals, while developing improved strength, endurance, motor planning and balance.  Therapists work to help regulate muscle tone, integrate unwanted reflex patterns and improve alignment.    Therapists also work with patients to improve their motor patterns through repetition while in correct alignment.
Before any exercise has started, therapists spend time manually working with children with a variety of modality options that might include heat, massage oil, brushing and other sensory inputs.  This is all to prepare the body  to prepare the body for exercise and motor inputs.   Manual techniques might include myofascial release, total motion release, strain/counterstrain, massage or a variety of other techniques!

Orthotic Suit
During therapy, most children 2  1/2 years or older,  spend time in either the NeuroSuit or Therasuit.   The suit is made of a vest, shorts, shoes, and rubber bungees. The suits  simultaneously provide resistance and support to a patient. It helps their body find better alignment, while the bungee cords provide a comforting compression to the joints and distribute vertical weight-bearing to the entire body.
The bungees mimic the major muscle groups, and when skillfully applied, can help patients learn better patterns of movement and gain correct muscle memory that carries over even after the suit is removed.

Universal Exercise Unit
Now I Can uses the Universal Exercise Unit to help patients isolate, stretch, and strengthen specific muscles.  This piece of equipment uses weights and pulleys to allow the therapist to facilitate different stretches and exercises while keeping their hands free to help their patient.  The UEU also helps children work on functional skills such as sit-to-stand, kneeling and jumping to name a few.

At Now I Can, our physical therapists inspire and motivate children to help them reach new developmental milestones.
Our therapy team creates an individualized plan for every child that comes through our doors.  Along with our intensive programs, we offer traditional physical therapy appointments. Traditional therapy sessions are ideal for keeping the body limber, strengthened and moving toward milestones.  These visits are more frequent and on-going, and are offered on a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis according to our schedule and your needs.

Longer sessions enable the child’s brain more time to create new pathways and learn new skills. The gift of time allows the physical therapist to use manual techniques and do more treatment than possible in a typical 45-minute session.

## Dynamic Orthotic Suit — Now I Can Foundation

![[https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/619bb52cb80989574ac52490/8e22fc86-bcc5-46d9-9f66-6221d1b3f577/H-Suit-therapy.jpg]]
Orthotic Suit
Just like superheroes, our kids wear suits and achieve great feats!
Research shows that orthotic suits comprised of various resistance bands in placed over major muscle groups, can greatly increase a child’s mobility achievements. Now I Can therapists are experienced in accurately assessing where to place the bungees, which order to train the muscles, and the amount of resistance required for each child’s specific needs. We love using this therapy tool at Now I Can!
![[https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/619bb52cb80989574ac52490/2aeb5562-0d40-4389-a339-b425dc9bb5a0/Suit-Therapy-Page-Spot1.jpg]]
Made of soft canvas, our suit is a breathable, dynamic orthotic that improves and changes proprioception (the brain’s awareness of the position and movement of the body). It works by loading the entire body with weighted resistance bands that mimic real-life muscular reaction to gravitational forces. Wearing the suit reduces pathological reflexes and also restores physiological muscle synergies.
Each child wearing the suit will move through exercises that help them experience “normalized” movements and gait patterns. How the suit is worn, and how the straps engage the body through resistance, cause the nervous system to send new messages to the vestibular system.
![[https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/619bb52cb80989574ac52490/a20ab1b4-1638-47db-93dd-4a8b59acb657/Suit-Therapy-Page-Spot3.jpg]]
In neuromuscular conditions, such as Cerebral Palsy, the information from the body is misinterpreted by the brain reducing body awareness and overall function.  The good news is that by using Suit Therapy we can override unwanted signals and replace them with correct information, which is then sent to the brain. Through thousands of repetitive actions performed while using Suit Therapy, kids can start to retrain their brains and achieve next-level change.
Compared to traditional therapy, Suit Therapy—as part of an intensive training program—is an ideal way to accelerate a child’s progress and rapidly attain new levels of achievement.

Universal Exercise Unit
We want to see your child reach milestones.  Improvements in crawling, sitting, walking, even jumping - are all within reach with the help of the Universal Exercise Unit (UEU).
The Universal Exercise Unit holds the child with bungee cords attached to a belt around their waist. Pulleys and weights may also be used to create muscle isolation and improve strengthening.  The UEU allows therapists to have free hands to help the child perform the exercises correctly. The bungees allow kids to feel themselves in space, improve balance and have needed support while stretching, doing sit to stand, or balancing on one leg.  The UEU opens the door to a whole new set of treatments that can rapidly help patients achieve maximum function in gait, balance and coordination.
The best part about the Universal Exercise Unit is that it’s
fun
!  With a few adjustments to the bungee support, kids can learn to jump and “fly” in the air.  It’s so fun to see children experience movements and sensations they’ve never been able to experience before!
Benefits of UEU treatment
Increased range of motion
Isolates desired muscle groups to strengthen them and enable function
Eliminates gravitational forces acting on the body
Improves balance
Improves coordination
Promotes developmental milestones
Facilitates upright position, improving breathe support and decreasing pressure
Promotes independence and overall improved physical image

Manual Therapy at Now I Can
Now I Can therapists provide the hands-on evaluation and personalized therapy your child deserves. Applying the newest innovations, our physical therapists use manual therapy as a tool to prepare the body to achieve better range of motion or improved alignment. We use a combination of massage and pressure point techniques to target joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons, fascia, and lymphatic fluid in areas affected by neuromuscular disorders, faulty movement patterns, or injury.
These hands-on therapies help to alleviate pain, stiffness, spasticity, swelling, guarding, and other imbalances.

Soft Tissue Mobilization and Myofascial Release
Soft Tissue Mobilization restores mechanical movement and increases range of motion by releasing tension within scar tissue and fascia. Fascia are sheets of fibrous tissue that surround and support muscles by separating them into layers. Neuro disorders and injury may cause both fascia and muscles to shorten, restricting movement and blood flow. Our soft tissue mobilization  and Myofascial Release techniques apply different levels and directions of pressure to target areas resulting in the breakdown of muscle adhesions.

Joint Mobilization
When joint structures are out of alignment they may interfere with normal range of motion by introducing mechanical hiccups like “sliding “or “pivoting.”
Using small and specific movements, our physical therapists manually move a target synovial joint through natural levels of resistance. These motions stretch and strengthen the tissue surrounding the joint bone—normalizing joint motion, reducing spasms, and controlling pain.

Strain-Counterstrain
The goal of the Strain-Counterstrain technique is to correct postural and structural issues originating from abnormal neuromuscular reflexes. It uses passive body positioning of muscles in spasm and repositions them toward ease that shortens the muscle. The purpose of shortening the muscle is to relax the reflexes that produce muscle spasm. In return, muscle tone begins to develop while joints gain greater range of motion and muscle pain reduces. This extremely gentle but effective technique of “releasing” muscles and connective tissue was developed by Dr. Lawrence Jones.

Muscle Energy Techniques
Muscle energy is an active technique used to reposition a dysfunctional joint and treat the surrounding muscles. It can be used to lengthen a shortened or spastic muscle or mobilize a joint that is stiff or restricted. The patient is guided through performing a specific muscle contraction against a resistive barrier (the physical therapist’s manual contact with the joint.) This process is repeated until visible muscle stretch and increased range of motion is achieved.

Functional Electrical Stimulation, more commonly called E Stim, is a dynamic technique that brings muscles back to life. The goal of E Stim is to restore or improve function and strength of the muscle by stimulating muscle movement and resetting muscle memory.
Therapy is conducted by placing a small adhesive on the skin, over a nerve or muscle. Slowly, and in low doses,  a mild electrical current that mimics brain signals is transmitted into the adhesives and received by targeted nerves and muscles. The result? Muscle stimulation that results in contraction. Fully paralyzed muscles and partially paralyzed muscles alike can slowly awaken and begin to regenerate.
With time and repetition, E Stim helps weak muscles gain strength and develop better tone.
E Stim therapy is used during functional activities and can be used on all parts of the body.

## Full Body Vibration — Now I Can Foundation

Vibration Plate
A type of neuro-muscular re-education, vibration therapy ultimately works to increase communication between the body and the brain. When a child stands on, or otherwise engages with, our vibration plates, each motion transfers a quick burst of energy to the child which then engages the involuntary stretch reflex and causes muscles to contract and relax multiple times per second.
The high repetition rate (frequency) of the vibrations, plus the alternating tilt of the plates, causes rhythmic muscle contractions between the right and left side of each muscle, mimicking a human gait. (The motion is similar to the way a pelvis moves and tilts when walking.)
The result? The brain receives thousands of signals which enhances neuroplasticity, which then translates into motor relearning. Tense muscles begin to relax,  balance improves, muscles strengthen, bone density increases, spasms decrease, and over all there is a lessening of complications associated with disorders that restrict movement and limit sensory processing.
Your Now I Can Foundation therapists are able to assess your child’s range of ability then formulate a vibration plate action plan that produces optimized change.
Vibration Plate Therapy Benefits:
·         Reduce spasticity
·         Gain muscle tone and power
·         Improve motor function
·         Enhance gait speed
·         Create higher bone mass

Kinesiotape
Kinesiotape is made from breathable cotton fabric strips with adhesive on one side. Designed specifically to be worn on the body,  Kinesiotape is used to help support and restore balance within muscles. By placing Kinesiotape in specific arrangements we can activate weaker muscles, assist injured muscles in recovery, and reduce the severity of over-contracting muscles.
Kinesiotape is also used to encourage the correct positioning of a body segment while inhibiting certain muscles. This simple application has also been found to increase the effectiveness of the lymphatic system.
The positive effects of taping continue for 24-hours a day for several days after application. Kinesiotape is hypoallergenic, water-resistant, and comfortable, so it can be left on for bathing, swimming, and other activities.

Neuro-Developmental Treatment (NDT)
Neuro-Developmental Treatment (NDT) is a hands-on therapy approach that works to override incorrect neurological signals being sent to the body and create new neuro-pathways that help children move in ways they’ve never moved before, or regain ability that has been lost.
Our therapists will manually control specific movements to ensure there is proper stimulation of tactile, vestibular, and somatosensory receptors within the body.
Frequent repetition of these therapeutic movements will create muscle memory that allows the child to develop a trusted set of movements they can use on a daily basis.
Not only will NDT help children achieve a basic skill set of movement, but its implementation also works to eliminate atypical postures and motions that may eventually lead to secondary impairments as the child gets older.

PNF
Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) is an advanced form of flexibility training that involves both the stretching and contracting of muscle groups.
This hands-on therapeutic exercise method generally produces excellent results in children with neuromuscular and orthopedic conditions.
PNF implements specific stretching techniques that stimulate and facilitate proprioceptive centers within joints, muscles and tendons. As these areas “come to life”, flexibility and range of motion increases and normalized patterns of movement begin to emerge and replace old patterns.
Through a detailed evaluation, the Now I Can team will design a therapeutic plan to incorporate the most appropriate PNF techniques to decrease and/or increase tone, gain range of motion, and improve coordination and control of neuromuscular function.

Total Motion Release
Our total motion release technique uses the principles of “Strain Counterstrain” to alleviate pain and dynamically increase range of motion and comfort throughout the body.
It starts with hands-on therapy that gently guides spasmed muscles and debilitated joints into agreeable, shortened muscle positions. This new alignment blocks spasms and delivers a calming release to affected muscles. Relaxed muscles allow previously restricted joints to attain greater levels of motion release. While in this position of counter-strain the therapist will have your child perform simple exercises that work to strengthen the body and maintain proper alignment and function.

Our son, Canyon, was born with cerebral palsy. We were referred to “Now I Can” by a friend whose brother had benefited from the amazing therapy that they provide. I can honestly say “Now I Can” has changed our sons life! I have never met a team of people so dedicated and willing to do anything to help our child. When we first started going to “Now I Can” my son couldn’t even crawl; now he can crawl and has started walking using a walker. Because of their continuous love and dedication to helping our son, we have made it a priority to continue getting these services every year. “Now I Can” gives us continuous hope for his future.

Our son has had the privilege of participating in the Now I Can therapy program on two different occasions this year.
Bronson (age 2) has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and lacks basic functionality in his legs. As his parents, we’re committed to giving Bronson every opportunity to progress as far as he can given his physical disabilities. We found that Now I Can's highest priority is to also help children like Bronson reach their goals.
The staff and therapists at Now I Can are always friendly and have become close friends to Bronson and our family. Each 3 week therapy session starts with a sit down meeting where together with the therapist, we establish goals for Bronson and his near future. We feel that the therapists do exceptional work when customizing a plan to help Bronson reach his goals and ultimate potential.
We have loved this opportunity and feel very privileged to be given the chance to become part of the Now I Can family. Our hope is to continue working with Now I Can to help Bronson reach his fullest potential!

Our son Liam has cerebral palsy and requires a lot of help with walking and standing and just doing everyday things. He uses a walker and is very independent in his own way. We have gone to the Now I Can for 4 years and we have loved every single hour Liam has spent there. When he does his summer sessions which requires him to go M-F for 4 hours, he wakes up every morning asking if it's a Now I Can day. He LOVES it. He is always so sad when it's over.
We have seen so much improvement in Liam since he’s been going to NIC. They helped him learn how to ride a bike and he rides it all the time now. The freedom that they have given him through all the hard work is amazing. He loves the time there and is always looking forward to
it. We have learned so much as parents about our son’s therapy programs and love how we are given a therapy plan for home when he finishes his summer therapy. It's so helpful to have something written out and with clear instructions on how to do everything. We plan on going to Now I Can every summer!

Now I Can has changed our daughter, Lauren’s life!  We found Now I Can by divine intervention, literally.  When we booked Lauren’s first session, we were not exactly sure what to expect, but we knew we were meant to get her there for treatment!   The type of treatment Lauren was receiving was new to us. We were intrigued by the various methods, models and techniques the physical therapists used with Lauren.  The Suit, Spider Cage and vibration plate were brand new to us. Lauren enjoys using them in her intensive sessions!  The magical gift of time allows Lauren to do things in PT that she would never have time to do in traditional therapy.
The gains we saw within the first week in her flexibility, mobility and confidence alone are amazing!  Each summer she looked forward to her intensive sessions in Utah.  The staff at Now I Can are caring, fun, knowledgeable, warm and welcoming.  We were so inspired by what we experienced at Now I Can in Utah, we decided to partner with Now I Can to bring a facility to the east coast so that other families can experience the transformation therapy found at Now I Can.

Therapy Grants
Special needs parents yearn to see their child hit the milestones that most reach without any effort at all. These parents watch their children put enormous effort into their physical therapy sessions, hoping to see great results.
The significant cost of intensive therapy proves worthwhile time and time again, but at Now I Can we understand how many other needs your children have that also require funds: wheelchairs, crutches, braces, adaptive shoes & clothing, medical equipment & supplies, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nurses, aides, and more. Choosing intensive physical therapy, as life-changing as it is, competes with other needs for the same family dollars.
The good news is, in addition to providing therapy and care unmatched by traditional PT clinics, Now I Can Foundation is pleased to provide grants for many patients through our Ability Fund. While we always ask families to pay
some
, we are happy to lighten the burden and make it possible for more kids to say “now I can”!

A specific committee of board members reviews grant applications, and then carefully allocates the funds raised from events and donors to families based on need. Because we know the financial needs all of our families experience, we try to give some amount to all who ask. We want to make sure that money is never the reason a child cannot come to Now I Can for physical therapy!

Tracey and Joel Christensen
Now I Can Founders

The Christensen’s appreciate the meaningful experiences and people that Now I Can has brought to their lives over the years.
Tracey is currently the Executive Director of Now I Can and she and Joel serve on the Board of Directors together. In his day job, Joel is the University Budget Director at BYU, but in his spare time he enjoys being active, having fun with family, and being Now I Can’s premier handyman!
Joel’s educational background includes majoring in Exercise Science and an MBA from BYU. Tracey’s degree is in Broadcast News, and she spent many years working in that field, and teaching scripture to high school students. She mostly loves being a Mom to her now young-adult kids.
Joel and Tracey feel blessed to know the children and families of Now I Can!
Colby’s Story
Hi, my name is Colby Christensen. I want to tell you my story, how it led to “Now I Can”, and how their approach to physical therapy changed my life.
When I was a baby I was diagnosed with Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy. Doctors told my parents that physical therapy could maybe help me, and I was referred to a local therapy office. In a couple years I was able to make small changes, but my parents couldn’t help but wonder if maybe there was MORE? They did their homework and when I was four years old my Mom and Dad took me to Poland to try a “new” treatment. The treatment was called the Intensive Model of Therapy (IMOT for short).  At home, in Utah, my traditional physical therapy sessions lasted 45-minutes, once a week. But the IMOT I received in Poland had me in innovative physical therapy sessions that were 3-hours long and occurred 5 days a week! The therapy was physically challenging, but it was also fun. The best part was that I could feel and see myself gaining strength fast. In just a few weeks I had discovered new ways to make my body move. It was so exciting!
The results I got using IMOT were too good to ignore. That’s why my Mom and Dad started an IMOT clinic in Utah to help me—and other kids like me--reach amazing goals that traditional PT would not have allowed. They named the clinic Now I Can.
If your child has a neuromuscular disorder like me, you’ve probably spoken to surgeons and watched helplessly as your child went through intervention after intervention. When I was small that’s how it went for me—but introducing intensive physical therapy into my life changed all that. I just kept making progress which meant I didn’t need as many surgeries and interventions. Instead of spending my time recovering from surgery, or in therapy, I became an active teenager. I made the cheerleading team, I went to football games with friends and walked up and down the bleachers, and I eventually attended college fully able to walk across campus on my own.
Growing up doing intensive physical therapy at Now I Can didn’t just strengthen my body; it also strengthened my mind. My therapists have taught me how to be patient with myself and others. They’ve helped retrain my brain to see the positive in every situation, and they’ve helped me understand that it’s not about being the fastest, it’s about simply participating in an experience. (Which is way better than feeling sorry for yourself and doing nothing at all.) Sure, it takes me longer to do things—and sometimes I get frustrated—but then I remember to just let the bad thoughts go. This has made a big difference in my life because situations can have a totally different outcome just based on the way you look at it. My mom has always said it best, “Give every situation your very best and be proud knowing you gave it your all.”
Another life lesson I’ve learned through my time at Now I Can is that it’s okay to ask for help. I used to struggle, believing the lie that I had be independent and do everything by myself, but that’s not true at all. There’s not one person in the world who can do everything; we all need help with something. I wouldn’t be where I am today without all the willing help I’ve received. I am so grateful for my family and friends who have helped me with simple tasks like opening fruit snacks, tying my shoes, or doing my hair, as well as the bigger things. I’m still working hard to gain more independence, but it’s comforting to know I can always ask for help.
Do you want to know something else I love about Now I Can that has nothing to do with therapy?  It’s knowing the other patients.  Seeing other kids with disabilities working through therapy made me feel I wasn’t alone. It’s easy to be self-centered and so caught up in your own story that you forget that life is about building relationships. Without relationships life is lonely and kinda depressing. It feels good to consider other people; share a smile; start a conversation; be charitable--because you don’t know what the other person is going through. For me, connecting with other kids and families just made things better. As a young adult I have volunteered at Now I Can and every time I’m there those kids put a smile on my face. They remind me that life is good, and they inspire me to never stop trying.
An interesting thing happened to me a couple years ago. A friend interviewed me about living life with a disability. She asked, “If you could change having a disability, would you?” I immediately answered “No.” I was kind of surprised by my own response, but it’s very true. Even though living with a disability can be really hard sometimes, I’m definitely grateful for all the important things I’ve learned because of it. Almost all of those things I discovered or learned at Now I Can.
The intensive physical therapy I received as a child at Now I Can boosted my ability and impacted my life in many wonderful ways. I’m so glad my parents didn’t settle for “average” therapy, but instead they searched for MORE and they gave me MORE at Now I Can.

In 2009 Allison and Troy welcomed their first child into the world, a beautiful daughter named Lauren. At 18-months Lauren was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Within months, physical therapy became a staple of their everyday living. As Lauren grew and faced new challenges they began to wonder: is there more we can do? When Lauren was 7-years old God answered their question as Allison learned about
Now I Can Foundation
in Utah.
As a family that enjoyed exploring the south-western states, Allison and Troy decided to make physical therapy a part of their summer vacation. They registered Lauren to receive 3-weeks of intensive physical therapy at Now I Can Foundation in Provo, UT. After just one week of therapy Allison and Troy were blown away by the amazing progress Lauren had made in such a short time span.  Allison’s eyes had been opened. There was MORE. And it came in a package called intensive physical therapy. This changed everything.
For the next five summers Allison and Troy took their children to Utah for a month. During the week Lauren would receive cutting-edge treatment, and on the weekends the family would take mini-trips to explore the national parks and visit new towns.
It was after summer number four that Allison recognized God was leading her to open an intensive physical therapy clinic in Pennsylvania that would serve children and families living on the East Coast.
Partnering with
Now I Can Foundation
in Utah, Allison and her brother, Ross, established
Now I Can Foundation North East
in the town of Lititz, Pennsylvania. The intensive physical therapy center is located on the same campus as Ross’s technology company, Listrak.
A long time First Grade teacher with a Masters in Education, Allison has a heart to see kids grow and achieve. She knows first hand that miracles happen every day–and she wants
Now I Can North East
to be a part of your family’s miracle.
