              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In 2009 Allison and Troy welcomed their first child into the world, a beautiful daughter named Lauren. At 18-months Lauren was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Within months, physical therapy became a staple of their everyday living. As Lauren grew and faced new challenges they began to wonder: is there more we can do? When Lauren was 7-years old God answered their question as Allison learned about Now I Can Foundation in Utah.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                As a family that enjoyed exploring the south-western states, Allison and Troy decided to make physical therapy a part of their summer vacation. They registered Lauren to receive 3-weeks of intensive physical therapy at Now I Can Foundation in Provo, UT. After just one week of therapy Allison and Troy were blown away by the amazing progress Lauren had made in such a short time span. Allison's eyes had been opened. There was MORE. And it came in a package called intensive physical therapy. This changed everything.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                For the next five summers Allison and Troy took their children to Utah for a month. During the week Lauren would receive cutting-edge treatment, and on the weekends the family would take mini-trips to explore the national parks and visit new towns.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                It was after summer number four that Allison recognized God was leading her to open an intensive physical therapy clinic in Pennsylvania that would serve children and families living on the East Coast. Partnering with Now I Can Foundation in Utah, Allison and her brother, Ross, established Now I Can Foundation North East in the town of Lititz, Pennsylvania. The intensive physical therapy center is located on the same campus as Ross's technology company, Listrak.
