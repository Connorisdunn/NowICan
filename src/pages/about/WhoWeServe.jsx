            At Now I Can, we believe that every child has unique potential waiting to be unlocked. Our approach is both personalized and comprehensive, taking into account each child's specific diagnosis, developmental stage, goals, and challenges.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Rather than focusing solely on the diagnosis, we look at the whole child - their strengths, challenges, family dynamics, and personal goals. This holistic perspective allows us to create therapy plans that address not just the physical symptoms, but also support overall development and quality of life.

            Our intensive therapy model provides the time and consistent engagement needed to make significant progress, often achieving in three weeks what might take months or even years in traditional therapy settings.
