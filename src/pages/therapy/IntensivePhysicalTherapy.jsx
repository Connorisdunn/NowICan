                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                  A unique characteristic of Now I Can physical therapy centers is the use of the Intensive Model of Therapy (IMOT). 
                  IMOT originated in Poland, and our founders, the Christensens took their daughter, Colby there to receive this effective therapy. 
                  This treatment model has proven to bring results for thousands of children.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                  Now I Can physical therapists design a tailored program for each patient, designed to meet their individual needs and goals. 
                  During an intensive session, many children gain greater independence and new developmental skills. 
                  It's very common for patients to see more progress in three weeks of intensive therapy than they do in 12 months of traditional therapy!

              During an Intensive Physical Therapy Session, we use the NeuroSuit and the Universal Exercise Unit. 
              Children from as young as 10 months see great results from intensive physical therapy. 
              Our team will be able to assess if a lighter schedule is best for your child.

                  Now I Can therapists treat patients for 4 hours a day, five days a week. 
                  An intensive program is three weeks in length, but weekly sessions are also part of Now I Can's services.

                  At Now I Can, children work toward their specific functional goals, while developing improved strength, endurance, motor planning and balance. 
                  Therapists work to help regulate muscle tone, integrate unwanted reflex patterns and improve alignment. 
                  Therapists also work with patients to improve their motor patterns through repetition while in correct alignment.

                <p className="text-lg">
                  Before any exercise has started, therapists spend time manually working with children with a variety of modality options 
                  that might include heat, massage oil, brushing and other sensory inputs. This is all to prepare the body for exercise and motor inputs. 
                  Manual techniques might include myofascial release, total motion release, strain/counterstrain, massage or a variety of other techniques!

                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                  During therapy, most children 2Â½ years or older, spend time in either the NeuroSuit or Therasuit. 
                  The suit is made of a vest, shorts, shoes, and rubber bungees. The suits simultaneously provide resistance 
                  and support to a patient. It helps their body find better alignment, while the bungee cords provide a 
                  comforting compression to the joints and distribute vertical weight-bearing to the entire body.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                  The bungees mimic the major muscle groups, and when skillfully applied, can help patients learn better 
                  patterns of movement and gain correct muscle memory that carries over even after the suit is removed.

                  Now I Can uses the Universal Exercise Unit to help patients isolate, stretch, and strengthen specific muscles. 
                  This piece of equipment uses weights and pulleys to allow the therapist to facilitate different stretches and 
                  exercises while keeping their hands free to help their patient.
