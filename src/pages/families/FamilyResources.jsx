When we booked Lauren's first session, we were not exactly sure what to expect, but we knew we were meant to get her there for treatment! The type of treatment Lauren was receiving was new to us. We were intrigued by the various methods, models and techniques the physical therapists used with Lauren. The Suit, Spider Cage and vibration plate were brand new to us. Lauren enjoys using them in her intensive sessions! The magical gift of time allows Lauren to do things in PT that she would never have time to do in traditional therapy. The gains we saw within the first week in her flexibility, mobility and confidence alone are amazing! Each summer she looked forward to her intensive sessions in Utah. The staff at Now I Can are caring, fun, knowledgeable, warm and welcoming. We were so inspired by what we experienced at Now I Can in Utah, we decided to partner with Now I Can to bring a facility to the east coast so that other families can experience the transformation therapy found at Now I Can.",

I can honestly say \"Now I Can\" has changed our sons life! I have never met a team of people so dedicated and willing to do anything to help our child. When we first started going to \"Now I Can\" my son couldn't even crawl; now he can crawl and has started walking using a walker. Because of their continuous love and dedication to helping our son, we have made it a priority to continue getting these services every year. \"Now I Can\" gives us continuous hope for his future.",

Bronson (age 2) has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and lacks basic functionality in his legs. As his parents, we're committed to giving Bronson every opportunity to progress as far as he can given his physical disabilities. We found that Now I Can's highest priority is to also help children like Bronson reach their goals. The staff and therapists at Now I Can are always friendly and have become close friends to Bronson and our family. Each 3 week therapy session starts with a sit down meeting where together with the therapist, we establish goals for Bronson and his near future. We feel that the therapists do exceptional work when customizing a plan to help Bronson reach his goals and ultimate potential. We have loved this opportunity and feel very privileged to be given the chance to become part of the Now I Can family. Our hope is to continue working with Now I Can to help Bronson reach his fullest potential!",

We have gone to the Now I Can for 4 years and we have loved every single hour Liam has spent there. When he does his summer sessions which requires him to go M-F for 4 hours, he wakes up every morning asking if it's a Now I Can day. He LOVES it. He is always so sad when it's over. We have seen so much improvement in Liam since he's been going to NIC. They helped him learn how to ride a bike and he rides it all the time now. The freedom that they have given him through all the hard work is amazing. He loves the time there and is always looking forward to it. We have learned so much as parents about our son's therapy programs and love how we are given a therapy plan for home when he finishes his summer therapy. It's so helpful to have something written out and with clear instructions on how to do everything. We plan on going to Now I Can every summer!",

                      behind our foundation. Diagnosed with Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy as a baby, Colby's journey with intensive 
                      therapy led to remarkable progress that traditional therapy alone couldn't provide.
