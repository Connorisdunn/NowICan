You are tasked with redoing the website for a nonprofit organization called NowICan. Their website currently is hard to navigate, has stubbed and incorrect links, and can use a lot of Pro design work, exactly what you specialize at. Looking through Now I Can's website, what stands out isn't just the physical therapy services they provide - it's the profound impact they have on children's lives and their families' futures. Every child who comes through their doors has dreams and potential waiting to be unlocked. Through intensive therapy, kids who were told they might never walk are taking their first steps. Families who felt isolated are finding hope and community.
Our work revamping their website isn't just about improving code or design - it's about helping more families discover this life-changing resource. Every optimization we make, every form we streamline, every piece of content we clarify could be the difference between a family finding Now I Can or continuing to search for answers. When we make their site more accessible and user-friendly, we're helping parents who are already dealing with so much to more easily find the support their children need.
The stories of kids like Colby, who went from requiring constant assistance to becoming an active teenager and college student, show us the real impact of Now I Can's work. By volunteering our skills to improve their digital presence, we become part of that impact. Let's build something that serves these families and honors the incredible work happening at Now I Can's facilities in Utah and Pennsylvania.

Their site's current text content has been given to you in a file called old-content.txt. In making this new website for them, use mostly the same images they link to already, and much of the same content, but feel at liberty to reorganize it, split or combine it etc. If there's a page we're making that doesn't have content written already, write the content yourself, and make a small reminder box that you made this content up so we can go back and make sure it's factual later. For now, just focus on making the website look stellar so the nonprofit can accomplish its purpose.

The website uses a vibrant rainbow-like sequence of modern, friendly colors - flowing from blue to green to purple to coral - creating an approachable and optimistic feel that's perfect for a nonprofit foundation.

While designing this website, take a lot of UX initiative to think about what users will be using the page. For example, the current "Schedule a free consultation" page just lets you input your information, but think about how important it would be for a family to know when they're gonna hear back, who is reading this application, etc. With that in mind, showing the user a simple flow chart of where their application is going and when they should expect to hear back might be really great for them to see! Make this page modern, intuitive, and a joy to use so it can serve those who need the non-profit's help, those who are are already there, those who are just curious and those who are looking for a way to help.

On the homepage, for example, we'd like a Hero section that shows a video of what the office and doctors look like, to help people see how amazing of a place this is. We can have a theme spread across the page like "Helping children move mountains," and call to action buttons to let people schedule a "Free Consultation" or "Get Involved" by donating or volunteering. Underneath the Hero section, the landing page starts to communicate "What makes us different."

The site's organization and content should roughly be the following:

```

```

However, not all of those need to be their own page. Combining similar elements can help the navigation and user experience be a lot simpler and more intuitive.
